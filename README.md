# spring-boot-starter
A very basic example on how to build a RESTful web service with Spring Boot 2.

On startup, Spring will set up an in-memory HSQL database. The database schema will be generated by Hibernate, matching
the given JPA entities in the `backend.domain` package. When the Spring application context has been initialized, the
database will be filled with some randomized dummy entries; see the `SampleData` component for details.

## Prerequisites
* JDK 8 or higher is required
* Maven 3 or higher is required

## Usage
To launch the server, build the project with Maven and simply start the jar file:
`mvn clean package && java -jar target/backend.jar`

## Concepts
The application shows examples for the following use cases:

* configuring a Spring application via annotations and application.properties file
* serviing static web content with the Spring Boot app (see the `static/` folder)
* creating an in-memory database
* connecting to a database from a Spring application
* dependency injection with Spring
* specification of JPA entities
* using Spring data repositories inside a Spring application
* using Spring data repositories as RESTful webservices
* using Spring Projections as a lightweight alternative to database views
* using Spring MVC REST controllers which offer more flexibility for when defining a web service API

## Notes
* during database schema generation, the HSQL database might throw an error; the schema generation should succeed
  nonetheless and the application should still be usable with all sample data
